B. Peak Load (Worst-Case Synchronization)
Mostly peak load would be happening at mid night when all the instruments will be executing a semi structured service data workflow. This workflow has following requests initiated by the instruments

For PoC testing, and to closely simulate realistic conditions, we assume that JMeter will initiate 4 iterations, each consisting of 3,000 requests, with an interval of 5 seconds between iterations.
If all requests are processed with no or minimal rejections and with an average response time in the range of 10–15 seconds from the Lite Gateway, the PoC will be considered successful.
Tests should be executed in an environment that closely mirrors the field setup. This includes validating mTLS connectivity between the instruments and the Lite Gateway, as well as between the Lite Gateway and the Cloud Gateway.
The Cloud Gateway should introduce a 5-second artificial delay to realistically simulate end-to-end processing time. Additionally, since the instruments do not have Keep-Alive enabled, testing must be performed with the same configuration to accurately reflect field behavior.

	Since the Cloud Gateway will be connected to multiple Lite Gateways, it must be capable of handling 4 iterations of 30,000 requests per iteration, initiated at 5-second intervals, without degradation in performance or stability.
